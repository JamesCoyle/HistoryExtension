# Chrome History Viewer Extension

An extension for Chrome which shows the current browsing sessions history in the Chrome toolbar. It is designed to look like the new extensions panel and blend in seamlessly with the current Chrome UI. The popup is made entirely with Svelte which makes it so easy to render the list of history items.
